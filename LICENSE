SengOne Extension App

My patches and additions on top of my code are Licensed under the ABSE&CSRA&LATech ("Anyone But Stefan Esser or CSRA/LA Tech“) license.

Note that an additional exception to the license is added, forbidding use/redistribution of said content to CSRA and LA Tech too.
Note that this license will only be used as long as what would capstone decode.
Afterwards, all exceptions are cleared and basically WTFPL applies
