<h2><center>How to Sideload using Saurik's "impactor"</center></h2>
    
    <p>Prerequisites</p>
    
   <p>A windows, Mac, or Linux computer
    A Apple ID / Developer account
    A IPA file you wish to sign
    iPhone/iPad: a lightning or 30-pin cable (depending on your device)
    Instructions</p>
    
    <p>Please note the same sideloading with free account restrictions apply</p>
    
    <p>Plug in your iOS device
    Open "Impactor.exe" or the executable relating to your system
    Select your device in the device selection at the top
    Drag and drop an IPA file onto the tool
    Logging in with your developer account</p>
    
    <p>This tool does require logging in with your developer account / Apple ID, however, this is just to codesign.</p>
    
    <p>Saurik states:
    
    Unlike with many other tools that do IPA signature work in "the cloud" somewhere, your Apple ID and password are not sent by me to anyone but Apple. (Note: I am not claiming 25PP's tool does this, though it would not surprise me; I really have not used 25PP's tool, so I have no clue whether it is signing things in the cloud or locally.) One big thing to understand: if the tool does not have ready access to the private key for your Apple developer certificate (which is only the case if you are running it on a Mac and the key is in your keychain), then it will automatically revoke and reissue your Apple developer certificate, which you might have to deal with later.
    Which may clear up any thoughts you had.</p>
    
    <p>Post-Signing</p>
    
    <p>Once the IPA has been signed the tool will then install your IPA file. Enjoy. This tool is in beta and any issues should be reported here or directly to Saurik.</p>
    
    <p>Currently the tool does not support IPA's with embedded frameworks, however, he said that he will "probably work on it this week"</p>
